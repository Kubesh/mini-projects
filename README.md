# Mini Projects
This is just a small collection of my mini projects (couple of hours), where I explore a dataset.

The lion's share of these projects have come from finding an interesting dataset and seeing what exciting things I can find. The rest derive from an itching question buried in my head required scratching.

Thank you for taking a look at these. If you have any questions, or just want to leave a comment, please do! All ears and looking for improvements! ✌️

These projects are also available in blog form on my [website](https://www.kubesh.co/mini-projects, "Mini Projects by Kubesh").
